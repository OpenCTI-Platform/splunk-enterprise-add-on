# OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise

Version 1.1.1  
Author: Filigran  
Package: TA-opencti-for-splunk-enterprise


## Overview

The **OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise Add-on** provides a modular framework for integrating threat intelligence from [OpenCTI](https://filigran.io/platforms/opencti/) into Splunk.  
It enables analysts to collect, normalize, and enrich OpenCTI indicators and observables, making them searchable within Splunk Enterprise for correlation, detection, and incident response.


## Key Features

- Modular inputs for ingesting OpenCTI data via the OpenCTI Stream API.
- Ability to trigger OpenCTI actions in response of Alerts and to investigate them directly in OpenCTI
- Support for multiple object types (Indicators, Observables, Relationships, Sightings).
- Splunk is a named Security Platform (type SIEM) in OpenCTI, and the sightings of the alert actions
  reference OpenCTI indicators (STIX 2.1). See [Security Platform settings](#security-platform-settings).
- The Security Platform is detected from the OpenCTI schema: on OpenCTI releases without it the add-on
  behaves as before and logs why it is skipped.

## General Configuration

### OpenCTI user account

Before configuring the App, we strongly recommend that you create a dedicated account in OpenCTI with the same properties as for a connector service account.
To create this service account, please refer to [Create a Service Account](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/administration/users/?h=service+account#create-a-service-account) documentation.

### General Add-On settings

1. Navigate to Splunk Web UI home page, open the "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise Add-on" and navigate to "Configuration" page.
2. Click on "Account" tab and complete the form with the required settings:

| Parameter                  | Description                                                      |

![](./.github/img/addon_settings.png "Add-on settings")

Configuration parameters are stored securely in `local/passwords.conf`.  
Never ship credentials in `default/passwords.conf`.

If a proxy configuration is required to connect to OpenCTI platform, you can configure it on the Proxy page

| Parameter        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Enable Proxy`   | Determines whether a proxy is required to communicate with OpenCTI platform |
| `Proxy Type`     | The type of proxy to use                                                    |
| `Proxy Host`     | The proxy hostname or IP address                                            |
| `Proxy Port`     | The proxy port                                                              |
| `Proxy Username` | An optional proxy username                                                  |
| `Proxy Password` | An optional proxy password                                                  |

### Security Platform settings

The add-on identifies this Splunk deployment in OpenCTI as a **Security Platform** of type SIEM. The
sightings of the "OpenCTI - Create Sighting" alert action are made on it. Configure it on the
"Security Platform" tab of the Configuration page:

| Parameter                                | Description                                                                                                                                  | Default            |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `Security Platform ID`                   | Id (internal or STIX) of an existing OpenCTI Security Platform. Takes precedence over the name                                               | empty              |
| `Create the Security Platform`           | When no id is set, find the Security Platform by name, or create it (type SIEM)                                                               | enabled            |
| `Security Platform name`                 | Name used to find or create it                                                                                                               | `Splunk <server>`  |
| `Feature detection cache (minutes)`      | How long the capabilities read from the OpenCTI GraphQL schema are cached                                                                     | 60                 |

The resolved Security Platform is cached in the KV Store (`opencti_addon_state`) and shared by every
search head of a cluster, so members with different server names keep one Security Platform. Without a
configured name, the first default name recorded in that collection is used by every member, so members
resolving it for the first time at the same moment create one platform, not one each.

**OpenCTI account permissions.** The account of the add-on needs the capabilities of a connector service
account (bundle push and connector registration) plus "Knowledge: create / update" for the Security
Platform creation.

## OpenCTI Data Inputs Configuration

The "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise Add-on" enables Splunk to be feed with intelligence exposed through an OpenCTI live stream. 
To do this, the add-on implements and manages Splunk modular inputs.

When configuring a modular input, you have two options for storing intelligence data:
- Write directly to dedicated KV Store collections defined by the application
- Write to a Splunk index, which will then propagate the data to a KV Store using saved searches


### KV Store Ingestion Configuration

The KV Store data input type mode allows pre-defined KV Store to be directly fed with intelligence exposed by the OpenCTI live stream.

![](./.github/img/kvstore_based_ingestion.png "KV Store based ingestion")

Proceed as follows to enable the ingestion of data in pre-defined KV Store:

1. From the "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise Add-on" sub menus, select the "Inputs" sub menu.
2. Click on "Create new input" button.
3. Complete the form with the following settings:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Name`        | Unique name for the input being configured                                                                     |
| `Interval`    | Time interval of input in seconds. Leave as default (0) to allow continuous execution of the ingestion process |
| `Index`       | Leave empty. Not applicable when writing directly to KV Store                                                  |
| `Stream Id`   | The Live Stream ID of the OpenCTI stream to consume                                                            |
| `Import from` | The number of days to go back for the initial data collection (default: 30) (optional)                         |
| `Input Type`  | Select KV Store entry                                                                                          |

4. Once the Input parameters have been correctly configured click "Add".

![](./.github/img/input_config_kvstore.png "KV Store Input Configuration")

5. Validate the newly created Input and ensure it's set to "Enabled".

As soon as the input is created, the ingestion of data begins.

Here are the KV Store names used to store intelligence: 
- opencti_indicators: store STIX indicators and related context information (related threat actors, vulnerabilities, malware, attack patterns...)
- opencti_reports: store STIX reports
- opencti_markings: store STIX markings definitions
- opencti_identities: store STIX identities definitions

You can monitor the import of indicators using the following Splunk SPL query that list all indicators ingested in the 'opencti_indicators' KV Store:

```
| inputlookup opencti_indicators
```

You can also consult the "Monitoring Dashboard" which gives you an overview of indicators ingested in the 'opencti_indicators' KV Store.

![](./.github/img/indicators_dashboard.png "Indicators Dashboard")

The ingestion process can also be monitored by consulting the log file ```ta-opencti-for-splunk-enterprise_{DATA_INPUT_NAME}.log``` present in the directory ```$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/```

### Index-Based Ingestion Configuration (Required for Saved Searches)

When using **Index mode** ingestion, OpenCTI data is first written to a Splunk index and then synchronized into KV Store collections via saved searches.  
![](./.github/img/index_based_ingestion.png "Index based ingestion")

This section explains **how to define the index**, **configure macros**, and **enable the required saved searches**.


#### 1. Choose or Create a Splunk Index

By default, the add-on **does not assume a fixed Index name**.

#### Recommended default index
```
opencti_data
```
#### Create a dedicated index (recommended)

In Splunk Web:

1. Go to **Settings ▸ Indexes**
2. Click **New Index**
3. Set:
   - **Index name:** `opencti_data`
   - Leave other settings at defaults (or align with your data retention policy)
4. Save

> ⚠️ If you choose a **custom index name**, you must update the OpenCTI macro configuration (see below).

---

#### 2. Configure the OpenCTI Modular Input (Index Mode)

1. From the "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise" Add-on sub menus, select the "Inputs" sub menu.
2. Click on "Create new input" button.
3. Complete the form with the following settings:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Name`        | Unique name for the input being configured                                                                     |
| `Interval`    | Time interval of input in seconds. Leave as default (0) to allow continuous execution of the ingestion process |
| `Index`       | `opencti_data` (or your custom index)                                                                          |
| `Stream Id`   | The Live Stream ID of the OpenCTI stream to consume                                                            |
| `Import from` | The number of days to go back for the initial data collection (default: 30) (optional)                         |
| `Input Type`  | Select `Index entry`                                                                                           |

![](./.github/img/input_config_index.png "Index based Input Configuration")

4. Once the Input parameters have been correctly configured click "Add".

Once enabled:
- Each **OpenCTI stream event** is written as a **Splunk event**
- Events are **append-only**
- The same indicator may appear multiple times as it evolves over time

#### Event metadata

| Field        | Value                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `source`     | `opencti`                                   |
| `sourcetype` | `opencti:indicator`, `opencti:report`, etc. |

---

#### 3. Configure the OpenCTI Index Macro (Required)

All shipped saved searches rely on a macro to locate OpenCTI data.

#### Macro name

```
opencti_index
```

#### Default definition

```
index=opencti_data
```

#### How to configure

1. Go to **Settings ▸ Advanced Search ▸ Search macros**
2. Locate `opencti_index`
3. Edit the macro definition:
```
index=<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>
```
4. Save

> ⚠️ If this macro is not updated correctly:
> - Saved searches will return **zero results**
> - KV Store synchronization will silently fail

---

#### 4. Enable Required Saved Searches (Index → KV Store Sync)

Index mode relies on scheduled searches to populate KV Store collections.

#### Required saved searches

| Saved Search Name                           | Purpose                                            |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Update OpenCTI Indicators Lookup`          | Sync indicators into `opencti_indicators` KV Store |
| `Update OpenCTI Reports Lookup`             | Sync reports into `opencti_reports`                |
| `Nightly Rebuild OpenCTI Indicators Lookup` | Full rebuild safety net                            |

#### Enable them

1. Go to **Settings ▸ Searches, reports, and alerts**
2. Set **App context** to `TA-opencti-for-splunk-enterprise`
3. Enable:
- `Update OpenCTI Indicators Lookup`
- `Update OpenCTI Reports Lookup`
4. Verify schedules are enabled (default is sufficient)

#### 6. Common Failure Modes (and How to Avoid Them)

| Issue                       | Cause                       | Fix                    |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| No indicators in dashboards | Macro points to wrong index | Update `opencti_index` |
| KV Stores empty             | Saved searches disabled     | Enable saved searches  |
| Duplicate indicators        | Expected behavior           | Events are versioned   |

---

#### 7. Verification Checklist

Run these searches to confirm everything is working:

#### Index ingestion
```
`opencti_index`
| stats count by sourcetype
```

#### KV Store population

```
| inputlookup opencti_indicators
| head 10
```

## OpenCTI custom alert actions

You can use the "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise" to create custom alert actions that automatically create 'incidents' or/and 'incident response cases' or/and 'sighting' in response to alert trigger by Splunk.

### Create an incident or/and an incident response case or/and a sighting in OpenCTI

You can create an incident or an incident response case in OpenCTI from a custom alert action.
1. Write a Splunk search query.
2. Click Save As > Alert.
3. Fill out the Splunk Alert form. Give your alert a unique name and indicate whether the alert is a real-time alert or a scheduled alert.
4. Under Trigger Actions, click Add Actions.
5. From the list, select "OpenCTI - Create Incident" if you want the alert to create an incident in OpenCTI or "OpenCTI - Create Incident Response" if you want to create an incident response case in OpenCTI or "OpenCTI - Create Sighting" if you want to create a sighting in OpenCTI.

![](./.github/img/alert_actions.png "Custom Alert Actions")

6. To create and incident or an incident response case, complete the form with the following settings:

| Parameter                | Description                                           | Scope                             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `Name`                   | Name of the incident                                  | Incident & Incident response case |
| `Description`            | Description of the incident or incident response case | Incident & Incident response case |                              
| `Type`                   | Incident Type or incident response case type          | Incident & Incident response case |                              
| `Severity`               | Severity of the incident or incident response case    | Incident & Incident response case | 
| `Priority`               | Priority of the incident response case                | Incident response case            | 
| `Labels`                 | Labels (separated by a comma) to be applied           | Incident & Incident response case | 
| `TLP`                    | Markings to be applied                                | Incident & Incident response case | 
| `Observables extraction` | Method for extracting observables                     | Incident & Incident response case | 
| `Incident key`           | Optional result field names, comma-separated, read on every result (for example `event_id` for an ES notable, or `user,src` for a `stats ... by user src` search). Distinct values always create distinct objects, the same values upsert. Use field names, not `$result.<field>$` tokens: Splunk resolves those against the first result only | Incident & Incident response case |

Incidents and cases created from indexed events (results carrying `_cd` / `_raw`) get an id derived from
the event itself (its Splunk address, or its raw text with its `index`, `host`, `source` and `sourcetype`
when the search dropped `_cd`), so distinct events firing in the same second never merge (#47), while the same event
returned by overlapping scheduled runs keeps upserting onto one object. Rows of transforming searches
(`stats`, `table`...) should name their split-by fields in `Incident key`. Without it they keep the
historical name + time id; when several of them share that id in one run, the second and following rows
get distinct ids in row order, which only stays stable while the row order does (the action logs a
warning when this happens). A result without `_time` takes the time its alert was dispatched, read from
the alert's search id, so every retry of one triggered alert upserts the same object and a later run of
the alert creates a new one.

> Upgrading from 1.1.x: indexed events get new ids. An event already sent by 1.1.x and returned again by
> an overlapping scheduled run just after the upgrade creates a second object, once.

7. To create a sighting, complete the form with the following settings:

| Parameter                | Description                                                   | Scope      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `Sighting Of (value)`    | Value of what was sighted                                     | Sighting   |
| `Sighting Of (type)`     | Type of what was sighted: an Indicator (`Indicator ID`, or `URL`, `Domain`, `IPV4`, `IPV6`, `File Hash`, `Email Address` Indicator, default `Domain Indicator`); the legacy `<type> Observable` types sight the matching Indicator | Sighting   |
| `Count`                  | Number of times the value was seen (for example `$result.count$`), default 1 | Sighting   |
| `Where Sighted (value)`  | Optional 'System' or 'Organization' that saw the sighting, in addition to the Splunk Security Platform | Sighting   |                              
| `Where Sighted (type)`   | 'System' or 'Organization' that saw the sighting              | Sighting   | 
| `Sighted on the Splunk Security Platform` | Adds the Splunk Security Platform (Configuration > Security Platform) to where the value was sighted (default) | Sighting |
| `Labels`                 | Labels (separated by a comma) to be applied                   | Sighting   | 
| `TLP`                    | Markings to be applied                                        | Sighting   | 

**Sightings of indicators (#57, #67).** STIX 2.1 sightings reference an Indicator: OpenCTI rules such as
"Raise incident based on sighting" and the sighting propagation only apply to them.
- `Indicator ID`: pass the STIX id of an indicator imported by the add-on, for example
  `... | lookup opencti_indicators value AS dest OUTPUT id AS indicator_id | where isnotnull(indicator_id)` and
  `Sighting of Value = $result.indicator_id$`. The sighting references this indicator directly.
- `<type> Indicator`: pass a raw value. The add-on looks for the indicator in `opencti_indicators`, then in
  OpenCTI by its exact STIX pattern, and otherwise creates the indicator from this single value (for
  example `[domain-name:value = 'example.com']`), with the id OpenCTI gives this pattern.
- `<type> Observable` types are kept for existing alerts only (the default is now `Domain Indicator`).
  Current OpenCTI rejects a sighting of an observable, so such an alert sights the matching
  `<type> Indicator`, resolved the same way. The observable is still sent, linked to that
  indicator by a `based-on` relationship.

The sighting `first_seen` / `last_seen` come from the `first_seen` / `last_seen` fields of the result when
present (epoch or ISO 8601, for example from `stats min(_time) AS first_seen max(_time) AS last_seen`),
otherwise from `_time`.

You can use [Splunk "tokens"](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.2/Alert/EmailNotificationTokens#Result_tokens) as variables in the form to contextualize the data imported into OpenCTI.
Tokens represent data that a search generates. They work as placeholders or variables for data values that populate when the search completes.

### Observables extraction

To extract and model alert fields as OpenCTI observables attached to the incident or incident response case, the Add-on purpose two methods describe below.

#### CIM model

The “CIM model” method is based on the definition of CIM model fields. With this method, the Add-on will extract all the following fields and model them as follows:

| CIM Field         | Observable type                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `url`             | URL observable                      | 
| `url_domain`      | Domain observable                   |                       
| `user`            | User account observable             |                            
| `user_name`       | User account observable             | 
| `user_agent`      | User agent Observable               |

#### Field mapping

The “Field mapping” method searches for event fields starting with the string “octi_” and ending with an observable type.
The following list describe list of supported fields:

| OCTI Field                         | Observable type                       |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `octi_ip`                          | IPv4 or IPv6 observable               | 
| `octi_url`                         | URL observable                        |
| `octi_domain`                      | Domain observable                     |                       
| `octi_hash`                        | File observable                       |                       
| `octi_email_addr`                  | Email address observable              |                       
| `octi_user_agent`                  | User agent observable                 |                       
| `octi_mutex`                       | Mutex observable                      |                       
| `octi_text`                        | Text observable                       |                       
| `octi_windows_registry_key`        | Windows Registry Key observable       |                       
| `octi_windows_registry_value_type` | Windows Registry Key Value observable |                       
| `octi_directory`                   | Directory observable                  |                       
| `octi_email_message`               | Email message observable              |    
| `octi_file_name`                   | File observable                       |    
| `octi_mac_addr`                    | MAC address observable                | 
| `octi_user_account`                | User account address observable       |    

You can use the Splunk ```eval``` command to create a new field based on the value of another field.

Example:

```sourcetype=* | lookup opencti_indicators value as url_domain OUTPUT id as match_ioc_id | search match_ioc_id=* | eval octi_domain=url_domain | eval octi_url=url ```


Logs related to OpenCTI custom alerts are available in the following log files:

```$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/opencti_create_incident_modalert.log```

```$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/opencti_create_incident_response_modalert.log```

```$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/opencti_create_sighting_modalert.log```

An alert action exits with a non-zero code when at least one result could not be sent (#18), so failures
show in the Splunk alert action status (`index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd component=sendmodalert`).

## OpenCTI program compatibility

### Compatibility matrix

The add-on reads the OpenCTI GraphQL schema once per platform (cached in the KV Store, see
`Feature detection cache`) and enables each capability only where the platform provides it. Missing
capabilities are skipped with one log line such as
`Splunk Security Platform resolution: skipped, the OpenCTI platform (<version>) does not provide the Security Platform entity`.

| Add-on capability                                            | OpenCTI capability (detected)                                    | OpenCTI releases without it          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Ingestion, enrichment, Create Incident / Case / Sighting     | live streams, `stixBundlePush`                                   | always available                     |
| Splunk Security Platform (configured or auto-created)        | `securityPlatformAdd`, `securityPlatforms`                       | sightings use the selected System / Organization only |
