## OpenCTI Data Inputs Configuration

The "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise Add-on" enables Splunk to be feed with intelligence exposed through an OpenCTI live stream. 
To do this, the add-on implements and manages Splunk modular inputs.

When configuring a modular input, you have two options for storing intelligence data:
- Write directly to dedicated KV Store collections defined by the application
- Write to a Splunk index, which will then propagate the data to a KV Store using saved searches


### KV Store Ingestion Configuration

The KV Store data input type mode allows pre-defined KV Store to be directly fed with intelligence exposed by the OpenCTI live stream.

![](./.github/img/kvstore_based_ingestion.png "KV Store based ingestion")

Proceed as follows to enable the ingestion of data in pre-defined KV Store:

1. From the "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise Add-on" sub menus, select the "Inputs" sub menu.
2. Click on "Create new input" button.
3. Complete the form with the following settings:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Name`        | Unique name for the input being configured                                                                     |
| `Interval`    | Time interval of input in seconds. Leave as default (0) to allow continuous execution of the ingestion process |
| `Index`       | Leave empty. Not applicable when writing directly to KV Store                                                  |
| `Stream Id`   | The Live Stream ID of the OpenCTI stream to consume                                                            |
| `Import from` | The number of days to go back for the initial data collection (default: 30) (optional)                         |
| `Input Type`  | Select KV Store entry                                                                                          |

4. Once the Input parameters have been correctly configured click "Add".

![](./.github/img/input_config_kvstore.png "KV Store Input Configuration")

5. Validate the newly created Input and ensure it's set to "Enabled".

As soon as the input is created, the ingestion of data begins.

Here are the KV Store names used to store intelligence: 
- opencti_indicators: store STIX indicators and related context information (related threat actors, vulnerabilities, malware, attack patterns...)
- opencti_reports: store STIX reports
- opencti_markings: store STIX markings definitions
- opencti_identities: store STIX identities definitions

You can monitor the import of indicators using the following Splunk SPL query that list all indicators ingested in the 'opencti_indicators' KV Store:

```
| inputlookup opencti_indicators
```

You can also consult the "Monitoring Dashboard" which gives you an overview of indicators ingested in the 'opencti_indicators' KV Store.

![](./.github/img/indicators_dashboard.png "Indicators Dashboard")

The ingestion process can also be monitored by consulting the log file ```ta-opencti-for-splunk-enterprise_{DATA_INPUT_NAME}.log``` present in the directory ```$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/```

### Index-Based Ingestion Configuration (Required for Saved Searches)

When using **Index mode** ingestion, OpenCTI data is first written to a Splunk index and then synchronized into KV Store collections via saved searches.  
![](./.github/img/index_based_ingestion.png "Index based ingestion")

This section explains **how to define the index**, **configure macros**, and **enable the required saved searches**.


#### 1. Choose or Create a Splunk Index

By default, the add-on **does not assume a fixed Index name**.

#### Recommended default index
```
opencti_data
```
#### Create a dedicated index (recommended)

In Splunk Web:

1. Go to **Settings ▸ Indexes**
2. Click **New Index**
3. Set:
   - **Index name:** `opencti_data`
   - Leave other settings at defaults (or align with your data retention policy)
4. Save

> ⚠️ If you choose a **custom index name**, you must update the OpenCTI macro configuration (see below).

---

#### 2. Configure the OpenCTI Modular Input (Index Mode)

1. From the "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise" Add-on sub menus, select the "Inputs" sub menu.
2. Click on "Create new input" button.
3. Complete the form with the following settings:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Name`        | Unique name for the input being configured                                                                     |
| `Interval`    | Time interval of input in seconds. Leave as default (0) to allow continuous execution of the ingestion process |
| `Index`       | `opencti_data` (or your custom index)                                                                          |
| `Stream Id`   | The Live Stream ID of the OpenCTI stream to consume                                                            |
| `Import from` | The number of days to go back for the initial data collection (default: 30) (optional)                         |
| `Input Type`  | Select `Index entry`                                                                                           |

![](./.github/img/input_config_index.png "Index based Input Configuration")

4. Once the Input parameters have been correctly configured click "Add".

Once enabled:
- Each **OpenCTI stream event** is written as a **Splunk event**
- Events are **append-only**
- The same indicator may appear multiple times as it evolves over time

#### Event metadata

| Field        | Value                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `source`     | `opencti`                                   |
| `sourcetype` | `opencti:indicator`, `opencti:report`, etc. |

#### 3. Configure the OpenCTI Index Macro (Required)

All shipped saved searches rely on a macro to locate OpenCTI data.

#### Macro name

```
opencti_index
```

#### Default definition

```
index=opencti_data
```

#### How to configure

1. Go to **Settings ▸ Advanced Search ▸ Search macros**
2. Locate `opencti_index`
3. Edit the macro definition:
```
index=<YOUR_INDEX_NAME>
```
4. Save

> ⚠️ If this macro is not updated correctly:
> - Saved searches will return **zero results**
> - KV Store synchronization will silently fail

---

#### 4. Enable Required Saved Searches (Index → KV Store Sync)

Index mode relies on scheduled searches to populate KV Store collections.

#### Required saved searches

| Saved Search Name                           | Purpose                                            |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `Update OpenCTI Indicators Lookup`          | Sync indicators into `opencti_indicators` KV Store |
| `Update OpenCTI Reports Lookup`             | Sync reports into `opencti_reports`                |
| `Nightly Rebuild OpenCTI Indicators Lookup` | Full rebuild safety net                            |

#### Enable them

1. Go to **Settings ▸ Searches, reports, and alerts**
2. Set **App context** to `TA-opencti-for-splunk-enterprise`
3. Enable:
- `Update OpenCTI Indicators Lookup`
- `Update OpenCTI Reports Lookup`
4. Verify schedules are enabled (default is sufficient)

#### 6. Common Failure Modes (and How to Avoid Them)

| Issue                       | Cause                       | Fix                    |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| No indicators in dashboards | Macro points to wrong index | Update `opencti_index` |
| KV Stores empty             | Saved searches disabled     | Enable saved searches  |
| Duplicate indicators        | Expected behavior           | Events are versioned   |

---

#### 7. Verification Checklist

Run these searches to confirm everything is working:

#### Index ingestion
```
`opencti_index`
| stats count by sourcetype
```

#### KV Store population

```
| inputlookup opencti_indicators
| head 10
```

## OpenCTI custom alert actions

You can use the "OpenCTI for Splunk Enterprise" to create custom alert actions that automatically create 'incidents' or/and 'incident response cases' or/and 'sighting' in response to alert trigger by Splunk.

### Create an incident or/and an incident response case or/and a sighting in OpenCTI

You can create an incident or an incident response case in OpenCTI from a custom alert action.
1. Write a Splunk search query.
2. Click Save As > Alert.
3. Fill out the Splunk Alert form. Give your alert a unique name and indicate whether the alert is a real-time alert or a scheduled alert.
4. Under Trigger Actions, click Add Actions.
5. From the list, select "OpenCTI - Create Incident" if you want the alert to create an incident in OpenCTI or "OpenCTI - Create Incident Response" if you want to create an incident response case in OpenCTI or "OpenCTI - Create Sighting" if you want to create a sighting in OpenCTI.

### Observables extraction

To extract and model alert fields as OpenCTI observables attached to the incident or incident response case, the Add-on purpose two methods describe below.

#### CIM model

The “CIM model” method is based on the definition of CIM model fields. With this method, the Add-on will extract all the following fields and model them as follows:

| CIM Field         | Observable type                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `url`             | URL observable                      | 
| `url_domain`      | Domain observable                   |                       
| `user`            | User account observable             |                            
| `user_name`       | User account observable             | 
| `user_agent`      | User agent Observable               |
| `http_user_agent` | User agent Observable               |
| `dest`            | IPv4 or IPv6 or Hostname observable |
| `dest_ip`         | IPv4 or IPv6 observable             |
| `src`             | IPv4 or IPv6 or Hostname observable |
| `src_ip`          | IPv4 or IPv6 observable             |
| `file_hash`       | File observable                     |
| `file_name`       | File observable                     |


#### Field mapping

The “Field mapping” method searches for event fields starting with the string “octi_” and ending with an observable type.
The following list describe list of supported fields:

| OCTI Field                         | Observable type                       |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `octi_ip`                          | IPv4 or IPv6 observable               | 
| `octi_url`                         | URL observable                        |
| `octi_domain`                      | Domain observable                     |                       
| `octi_hash`                        | File observable                       |                       
| `octi_email_addr`                  | Email address observable              |                       
| `octi_user_agent`                  | User agent observable                 |                       
| `octi_mutex`                       | Mutex observable                      |                       
| `octi_text`                        | Text observable                       |                       
| `octi_windows_registry_key`        | Windows Registry Key observable       |                       
| `octi_windows_registry_value_type` | Windows Registry Key Value observable |                       
| `octi_directory`                   | Directory observable                  |                       
| `octi_email_message`               | Email message observable              |    
| `octi_file_name`                   | File observable                       |    
| `octi_mac_addr`                    | MAC address observable                | 
| `octi_user_account`                | User account address observable       |    

You can use the Splunk ```eval``` command to create a new field based on the value of another field.

Example:

```sourcetype=* | lookup opencti_lookup value as url_domain OUTPUT id as match_ioc_id | search match_ioc_id=* | eval octi_domain=url_domain | eval octi_url=url ```


Logs related to OpenCTI customer alerts are available in the following two log file:

```$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/opencti_create_incident_modalert.log```

```$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/opencti_create_incident_response_modalert.log```
